Sent from Me on Friday, April 18 2025, 9:40 PM :  i think we just genuinely have different things/actions we empathize with, both of these are things are sensitive to us specifically, so trying to really change that would be difficult
Sent from Me on Friday, April 18 2025, 9:45 PM :  if we do, i think we need to go in depth about where we’re coming from and what got us there instead, because i think that can change everything, and we both can learn as well
Sent from Paris on Friday, April 18 2025, 9:51 PM : Yeahh that’s more what I meant, just wanted to elaborate on things #deepconversation #gettoknowyoufriends
Sent from Paris on Friday, April 18 2025, 9:53 PM : Feel like dots weren’t connecting, did I ever tell you like the full spiel on Henry?

Sent from Me on Friday, May 30 2025, 12:21 AM : $time isn’t as important, just tell me if you’ve been super busy because sometimes i’m the same way. it comes from the perspective of like also going out of my way too to see what’s been happening with you, and if that’s like that long i can’t help but think of underlying meanings
Sent from Me on Friday, May 30 2025, 12:26 AM :  oh yeah that’s my bad, i’ve been in a weird place mentally recently and locking in on my side projects. it’s nothing personal trust me and i do really value you as a friend, but yess we should
