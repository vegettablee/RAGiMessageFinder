[THEM]  Might drop a “any reason why you decided to reach out now?” I wanna see if heel te’ll me anything that’s happening with Daisy rn
[THEM] 💀
[ME] i doubt he would wanna talk about it ngl
[ME] you’ll probably find more about the situation later anyways
[THEM] I won’t ask directly, just leaving the line open
[THEM] Yknow?
[ME] oh man
[ME] i can imagine how much this guy is hurting
[ME] i’d say just tell him it’s okay and then end the conversation as quickly as possible
[THEM] Yeah… like bros def going through it
[THEM] But like, we ain’t friends anymore 😭 and idek man it’s weird
[THEM] I wanna ask how he’s holding up but I also don’t
[ME] give him a few words of encouragement but don’t ask how he’s holding up because you already know it’s horrendous
[ME] you don’t gotta help him through it i’m sure he has other people he’s talking to already
[THEM] Alrighty
[ME] bro tell him that he didn’t do anything wrong 😭
[ME] i feel so bad for him

[THEM] Yeah……
[THEM] Like I really don’t like the guy, but it’s def a lot
[THEM] He knew that they had smth but idk the extent of allat

[THEM] Dudee
[THEM] The situation has me rethinking if I even want to stay friends with Daisy
[ME] i think it would be hard for paola to be in the wrong
[ME] i don’t think any amount of context could save daisy 😭
[THEM] Yeah, but like man it’s just nasty
[THEM] I’m not sure what to do
[ME] more like what can you do
[ME]  its one of those things that’s so complex, you can only provide an outside perspective that won’t ever encapsulate the emotional depth of paola and daisy
[ME] all you can do is make sure paola doesn’t act rash
[THEM] Yeah it’s more of Daisy did something
[THEM] And that’s why I’m like, should I even be friends with her anymore
[ME] what did daisy do
[THEM] Urgggg, again act suprised when she tells you

[THEM] Nah
[THEM] Just felt like the conversation needed to be finished
[THEM] You’re good
[ME] ohhh i see, i would want to finish it too but i think we’re just fundamentally different and that’s okay
[ME] and i’m sorry for using a condescending tone earlier, i still care for you as a friend
[THEM] Thanks for apologizing, honestly I was the same so I’m sorry too
[THEM] Lowkey I just feel like there’s some more to unpack, a little unsatisfied with  where it stopped
[THEM] Since I had to rush off, lmk if/when you would be down to continue 😛
[ME]  i think we just genuinely have different things/actions we empathize with, both of these are things are sensitive to us specifically, so trying to really change that would be difficult
[ME]  if we do, i think we need to go in depth about where we’re coming from and what got us there instead, because i think that can change everything, and we both can learn as well
[THEM] Yeahh that’s more what I meant, just wanted to elaborate on things #deepconversation #gettoknowyoufriends
[THEM] Feel like dots weren’t connecting, did I ever tell you like the full spiel on Henry?
[ME]  i came to the conclusion that what he did is something outside of something i can empathize with, but i do consider the act of cheating vastly different
[ME] 😭
[THEM] #storytime yeah very different things I could just tie things back to it
[THEM] Remind me to tell you
[ME] ohhh i see i see
[ME] okay, i’ll go in depth about the mistakes i made in my last relationship so we’ll both have a storytime
[THEM] See you on the flip side
[ME] 😏
[ME] i’ll see you
[ME] YOU FOUND IT
[ME] 16.99 gah damn

[ME] oh shi
[ME] i can go but i don’t have alcohol 🙁
[THEM] We’ll have a little, no worries
[ME] ok ok
[ME] how punctual should i be?
[ME] cause it already starts late and i get off work at like 10:30
[THEM] No rush I don’t think 🤷‍♀️ it’s pretty casual
[ME] i’ll buy 2 joints 😛
[ME] wait is it your apt?
[THEM] Yeah
[ME] why yall put 1934
[THEM] Whoops
[THEM] 😭😭
[ME] i knocked on a strangers door
[ME] was that yo boo thang
[ME] 🫣
[ME] rom was a chill homie tho
[THEM] LMAO, it’s a work in progress
[THEM] 😭a chill homie
[ME] i had to match the slang from the first message
[ME] mmmmmmmm
[ME] how’s your summer going?
[ME] we should catch up soon
[ME] ayy that’s good
[ME]  also respectfully, i don’t know what it is, but i’m not going to keep trying to keep this friendship alive if you respond super late
[ME] i can understand the reasons may or may not be deep at all, but just let me know
[THEM] Hey! I’m so sorry, that’s definitely not my intention things have been hectic with job apps and packing to move(not trying to make excuses) but I appreciate you being upfront about it:)
[THEM] I’ll for sure t try to be better about responding in a reasonable amount of time 🥲 is there anything else I can do?
[ME] no worries then, i understand 🙏
[THEM] I feel like I started putting in less effort because I wasn’t totally sure if you were still interested in being friends? 😭 but I definitely do care about you as a friend and we should DEFINETLY grab food or coffee and chit chat
[ME] $time isn’t as important, just tell me if you’ve been super busy because sometimes i’m the same way. it comes from the perspective of like also going out of my way too to see what’s been happening with you, and if that’s like that long i can’t help but think of underlying meanings
[ME]  oh yeah that’s my bad, i’ve been in a weird place mentally recently and locking in on my side projects. it’s nothing personal trust me and i do really value you as a friend, but yess we should
[ME] once you move in, any of the weekdays or a kickback would be lit af
[THEM]  That makes sense. My communication style has always been kinda low maintenance, not saying that’s better at awl, but that’s just what I know and I don’t always realize how it comes across
[THEM] All good, I’m always around if you need to chat about anything🙂‍↕️good to know you weren’t trying to cut me off or smth tho😭
[THEM] For shizzle
[THEM] How busy’s your schedule looking?
[ME] we still got our life 360s 😭
[ME]  it’s not necessarily busy, but i’ve been trying to keep momentum so i can stay productive with like the gym too, this week i was lacking tho 😔
